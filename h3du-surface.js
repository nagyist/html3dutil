/**
 * A surface evaluator object for a parametric surface.<p>
 * A parametric surface is a surface whose points are based on a
 * parametric surface function. A surface function takes two numbers
 * (U and V) and returns a point (in 1, 2, 3 or more dimensions, but
 * usually 2 or 3) that lies on the surface. For example, in 3
 * dimensions, a surface function has the following form:<p>
 * <b>F</b>(u, v) = [ x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) ]<p>
 * where x(u, v) returns an X coordinate, y(u, v) a Y coordinate,
 * and z(u, v) returns a Z coordinate.<p>
 * Classes or JavaScript objects defining parametric surfaces should implement
 * the <code>evaluate</code> method and, optionally, the other methods mentioned in the "surface" parameter below.
 * @constructor
 * @param {Object} surface A <b>surface evaluator object</b>, which is an object that

 * <b>F</b>(u, v) = (cos(u), sin(u), sin(u)*cos(v))<p>
 * Then, find the partial derivatives with respect to <i>u</i> and to <i>v</i>:<p>

 * &#x2202;<b>F</b>/&#x2202;<i>v</i> = (0, 0, -sin(v)*sin(u))<p>
 * Next, take their cross product:<p>
 * <b>&Del;F</b>(u, v) = (-sin(v)*cos(u)*sin(u), -sin(v)*sin(u)*sin(u), 0)<br><p>
 * The result is the gradient, which will point up and away from the surface.
