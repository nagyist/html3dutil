### (static) module:extras/polyhedra~Polyhedra.dodecahedron(radius, level)

Generates a mesh of a regular dodecahedron or a sphere based on that solid.

#### Parameters

* `radius` (Type: number)<br>Maximum radius from the center of the solid to one of its vertices.
* `level` (Type: number)<br>If 0 or less, generates the solid as is. If 1 or greater, subdivides each triangle on the solid's surface into smaller triangles and makes them bulge out to form an approximation of a sphere (the bigger the number, the smaller the triangles).

#### Return Value

The generated solid. (Type: MeshBuffer)

### (static) module:extras/polyhedra~Polyhedra.dodecahedronFaces()

vertex's X, Y, and Z coordinates are stored as three elements of that array),
and the second element contains an array of vertex indices (multiplying
each element by 3 will get the index to the first coordinate of the corresponding
