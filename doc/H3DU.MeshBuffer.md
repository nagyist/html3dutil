### new H3DU.MeshBuffer()

A geometric mesh in the form of buffer objects.
A mesh buffer is made up of one or more vertex attribute objects,
and an optional array of vertex indices. Each vertex attribute object contains
the values of one attribute of the mesh, such as positions,
vertex normals, and texture coordinates. A mesh buffer
can store vertices that make up triangles, line segments, or points.

This constructor creates an empty mesh buffer and sets the array
of vertex indices to null.

The `MeshBuffer` class contains four methods (`fromPositions`,
`fromPositionsNormals`, `fromPositionsUV`, and `fromPositionsNormalsUV`) that let you define a mesh buffer from a predefined array of vertex data. See the documentation for those methods for more information.

The <a href="H3DU.Meshes.md">`Meshes`</a> class includes several handy methods for creating built-in shapes; those methods return a `H3DU.MeshBuffer` object that describes the triangles they
are composed of.

<b>Instancing</b>

Some 3D rendering pipelines support <i>instancing</i>, which is a technique for rendering multiple versions of a mesh buffer with a single draw call. Instancing involves the use of a second mesh buffer (an <i>instance buffer</i>); rather than holding vertex data, the instance buffer holds <i>instance data</i>, that is, data to be used when rendering each instance of the first mesh buffer. Besides this, however, instance buffers are largely similar to vertex buffers as far as the <code>MeshBuffer</code> class is concerned; any reference to vertices in the documentation applies analogously to instances in instance buffers. However, instance buffers should use the primitive type <code>MeshBuffer.POINTS</code>; it makes little sense to have instance buffers describe triangles or line segments.

#### Examples

The following example converts a MeshBuffer object to three.js buffer geometries (and thus serves as a bridge between this library and three.js). Pass the return value to the <code>THREE.Mesh</code>, <code>THREE.LineSegments</code>, or <code>THREE.Points</code> constructor to generate the appropriate kind of shape object depending on the MeshBuffer's primitive type. This example requires the three.js library.

    function toBufferGeometry(mesh) {
    var p=mesh.getAttribute("POSITION")
    var n=mesh.getAttribute("NORMAL")
    var t=mesh.getAttribute("TEXCOORD_0")
    var c=mesh.getAttribute("COLOR")
    var ind=mesh.getIndices()
    var geom=new THREE.BufferGeometry()
    var attributes=[p,n,t,c]
    var attributeNames=["position","normal","uv","color"]
    for(var i=0;i<attributes.length;i++) {
    if(attributes[i]) {
    var a=attributes[i]
    //console.log(a)
    var attr=new THREE.InterleavedBufferAttribute(
    new THREE.InterleavedBuffer(a.buffer,a.stride),
    a.countPerValue,a.offset)
    geom.addAttribute(attributeNames[i],attr)
    }
    }
    if(ind)geom.index=new THREE.BufferAttribute(
    ind,1)
    return geom
    }

<a name='H3DU.MeshBuffer_recalcNormals'></a>
### H3DU.MeshBuffer#recalcNormals([flat], [inward])

Recalculates the normal vectors (directions that generally point up and away from the mesh buffer's surface) for triangles
in this mesh buffer, in order to give the shape described by this buffer a flat or smooth appearance or to shade the shape from the inside or the outside upon rendering.

 Each normal calculated will
be normalized to have a length of 1 (unless the normal is (0,0,0)),
and will be stored in an attribute with semantic <code>NORMAL_0</code>.

This method will have an effect only if the buffer includes an attribute with
semantic <code>POSITION_0</code> and each of that attribute's values is at least 3 elements
long. If the buffer already includes an attribute with semantic <code>NORMAL_0</code>,
ensures its values are each at least 3 elements long.

For normal calculation to properly affect shading:<ul>
<li>Each triangle's vertices in the mesh buffer (as they appear when the triangle's front side is seen) must be ordered in the same winding (counterclockwise or clockwise) throughout. If the vertices have the wrong order, use the <a href="H3DU.MeshBuffer.md#H3DU.MeshBuffer_reverseWinding">`reverseWinding()`</a>
method to change their order.
<li>If the mesh describes a closed convex surface (such as a sphere or cube) and is being rendered in a right-handed coordinate system (for example, X-right, Y-up, Z-backward), each of its triangles must have counterclockwise winding for the shape to be shaded from the outside.</ul>

#### Parameters

* `flat` (Type: boolean) (optional)<br>If true, each triangle in the mesh will have the same normal, which usually leads to a flat appearance. If false, each unique vertex in the mesh will have its own normal, which usually leads to a smooth appearance. If null, undefined, or omitted, the default is false.
* `inward` (Type: boolean) (optional)<br>If true, the generated normals will point inward, so that the shape is shaded from the inside upon rendering; otherwise, the normals will point outward. If null, undefined, or omitted, the default is false.

#### Return Value

This object. (Type: MeshBuffer)

#### Examples

    // Use flat shading, and shape is shaded from the outside
    meshBuffer.recalcNormals(true, false);
    // Both parameters can be omitted, setting both to false

### H3DU.MeshBuffer#reverseNormals()

Modifies this mesh buffer by reversing the sign of normals it defines.
Has no effect if this mesh buffer doesn't define any normals.
All attributes with the semantic <code>NORMAL</code>,
regardless of semantic index, are affected.

#### Return Value

This object. (Type: MeshBuffer)

#### Examples

The following code generates a two-sided mesh, where
the normals on each side face in the opposite direction.
This is only useful when drawing open geometric shapes, such as open
cylinders and two-dimensional planar shapes.
Due to the z-fighting effect, drawing a two-sided mesh is
recommended only if face culling is enabled.

    var twoSidedMesh = originalMesh.merge(
    new MeshBuffer().merge(originalMesh)
    .reverseWinding().reverseNormals()
    );

<a name='H3DU.MeshBuffer_reverseWinding'></a>
### H3DU.MeshBuffer#reverseWinding()

Reverses the winding order of the triangles in this mesh buffer
by swapping the second and third vertex indices of each one.
Has an effect only if this mesh buffer consists of triangles.

#### Return Value

This object. (Type: MeshBuffer)

#### Examples

The following code generates a mesh that survives face culling,
since the same triangles occur on each side of the mesh, but
with different winding orders.
This is only useful when drawing open geometric shapes, such as open
cylinders and two-dimensional planar shapes.
Due to the z-fighting effect, drawing this kind of mesh is
recommended only if face culling is enabled.

    var frontBackMesh = originalMesh.merge(
    new MeshBuffer().merge(originalMesh).reverseWinding()
    );

<a name='H3DU.MeshBuffer_setAttribute'></a>
### H3DU.MeshBuffer#setAttribute(name, buffer, countPerValue, [offset], [stride])

Adds information about a buffer attribute to this
mesh buffer (or sets an
existing attribute's information). An attribute
gives information about the per-vertex data used and
stored in a vertex buffer.

#### Parameters

* `name` (Type: number | string)<br>An attribute semantic, such as <a href="Semantic.md#Semantic.POSITION">Semantic.POSITION</a>, "POSITION", or "TEXCOORD_0". Throws an error if this value is a string and the string is invalid. If this isn't a string, the set index of the attribute will be 0 (see MeshBuffer#setAttributeEx).
* `buffer` (Type: Float32Array | Array)<br>The buffer where the per-vertex data is stored. See MeshBuffer#setAttributeEx.
* `countPerValue` (Type: number)<br>The number of elements in each per-vertex item. See MeshBuffer#setAttributeEx.
* `offset` (Type: number) (optional)<br>The index into the array (starting from 0) where the first per-vertex item starts.See MeshBuffer#setAttributeEx.
* `stride` (Type: number) (optional)<br>The number of elements from the start of one per-vertex item to the start of the next. See MeshBuffer#setAttributeEx.

#### Return Value

This object. Throws an error if the given
semantic is unsupported. (Type: MeshBuffer)

<a name='H3DU.MeshBuffer_setAttributeEx'></a>
### H3DU.MeshBuffer#setAttributeEx(name, index, buffer, [countPerValue], [offset], [stride])

Adds information about a buffer attribute to this
mesh buffer (or sets an
existing attribute's information), taking a semantic index as
an additional parameter. An attribute
gives information about the per-vertex data used and
stored in a vertex buffer.

#### Parameters

* `name` (Type: number | string)<br>An attribute semantic, such as <a href="Semantic.md#Semantic.POSITION">Semantic.POSITION</a>, "POSITION", or "TEXCOORD_0". Throws an error if this value is a string and the string is invalid.
* `index` (Type: number)<br>The semantic index of the attribute for the given semantic. 0 is the first index of the attribute, 1 is the second, and so on. This is ignored if "name" is a string.
* `buffer` (Type: Float32Array | Array | BufferAccessor)<br>The buffer where the per-vertex data is stored. If this parameter is an (untyped) Array, converts that parameter to a Float32Array.
* `countPerValue` (Type: number) (optional)<br>The number of elements in each per-vertex item. For example, if each vertex is a 3-element vector, this value is 3. Throws an error if this value is 0 or less. If "buffer" is a BufferAccessor, the value of "countPerValue" is taken from that accessor and this parameter is ignored; this parameter is currently required otherwise.
* `offset` (Type: number) (optional)<br>The index into the array (starting from 0) where the first per-vertex item starts. If null, undefined, or omitted, the default is 0. Throws an error if less than 0. If "buffer" is a BufferAccessor, the value of "offset" is taken from that accessor and this parameter is ignored.
* `stride` (Type: number) (optional)<br>The number of elements from the start of one per-vertex item to the start of the next. If null, undefined, or omitted, this value is the same as "countPerValue". Throws an error if this value is 0 or less. If "buffer" is a BufferAccessor, the value of "stride" is taken from that accessor and this parameter is ignored.

#### Return Value

This object.Throws an error if the given
semantic is unsupported. (Type: MeshBuffer)

<a name='H3DU.MeshBuffer_setColor'></a>
### H3DU.MeshBuffer#setColor(color)

Sets all the vertices in this mesh to the given color, by
assigning each value with the attribute semantic <code>COLOR</code>
to the given color. (If the attribute's count per value
is less than 4, each such value will be set to as many elements of the converted 4-element
color as possible.) If an attribute with the semantic <code>COLOR</code>
doesn't exist, an attribute with the semantic <code>COLOR_0</code> and a count per
value of 3 is created.

All attributes with the semantic <code>COLOR</code>,
regardless of semantic index, are affected by this method.

#### Parameters

* `color` (Type: Array.&lt;number> | number | string)<br>A color vector or string identifying the color to set.

#### Return Value

This object. (Type: MeshBuffer)

<a name='H3DU.MeshBuffer_setIndices'></a>
### H3DU.MeshBuffer#setIndices([indices])

Sets the vertex indices used by this mesh buffer.

#### Parameters

* `indices` (Type: Array.&lt;number> | Uint16Array | Uint32Array | Uint8Array | null) (optional)<br>Array of vertex indices that the mesh buffer will use. Can be null, in which case no index array is used and primitives in the mesh buffer are marked by consecutive vertices.

#### Return Value

This object. (Type: MeshBuffer)

<a name='H3DU.MeshBuffer_setType'></a>
### H3DU.MeshBuffer#setType(primType)

Sets the type of graphics primitives stored in this mesh buffer.

#### Parameters

* `primType` (Type: number)<br>The primitive type, either MeshBuffer.TRIANGLES, MeshBuffer.LINES, or MeshBuffer.POINTS. For TRIANGLES, every three vertices or vertex indices identify a single triangle. For LINES, every two vertices or vertex indices identify a single line segment. For POINTS, every vertex or vertex index identifies a single point.

#### Return Value

This object. (Type: MeshBuffer)

<a name='H3DU.MeshBuffer_transform'></a>
### H3DU.MeshBuffer#transform(matrix)

Transforms the positions and normals of all the vertices currently
in this mesh, with the help of a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">4 &times; 4 matrix</a>. Only values with the attribute semantic <code>POSITION_0</code>
or <code>NORMAL_0</code> will be affected by this method; values of
other attributes will be unaffected.

#### Parameters

* `matrix` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 4 &times; 4 matrix described in the MathUtil.mat4projectVec3 method. The normals will be transformed using the 3 &times; 3 inverse transpose of this matrix (see MathUtil.mat4inverseTranspose3). (Normals need to be transformed specially because they describe directions, not points.)

#### Return Value

This object. (Type: MeshBuffer)

#### Examples

The following example transforms positions
and normals to move the mesh 2 units to the right.

    mesh.transform(MathUtil.mat4translated(2, 0, 0));

The following example transforms positions
and normals to double the mesh's size.
