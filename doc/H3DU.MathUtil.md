<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat3multiply'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat3multiply(a, b)

Multiplies two 3 &times; 3 matrices. A new matrix is returned.
The matrices are multiplied such that the transformations
they describe happen in reverse order. For example, if the first
matrix (input matrix) describes a translation and the second
matrix describes a scaling, the multiplied matrix will describe
the effect of scaling then translation.

The matrix multiplication is effectively done by breaking up matrix <code>b</code>
into three 3-element vectors (the first 3 elements make up the first vector, and so on),
transforming each vector with
matrix <code>a</code>, and putting the vectors back together into a new matrix.

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first matrix.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second matrix.

#### Return Value

### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat3transform(mat, v, [vy], [vz])

Transforms a 3-element vector with a 3 &times; 3 matrix and returns
the transformed vector.

Transforming a vector (<code>v</code>) with a matrix (<code>mat</code>)
is effectively done by breaking up <code>mat</code> into three 3-element vectors
(the first 3 elements make up the first vector, and so on), multiplying
each vector in <code>mat</code> by the corresponding component in
<code>v</code>, and adding up the resulting vectors (except <code>v</code>) to
get the transformed vector.

#### Parameters

* `mat` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 3 &times; 3 matrix.
* `v` (Type: Array.&lt;number> | number)<br>X coordinate. If "vy", and "vz" are omitted, this value can instead be a 4-element array giving the X, Y, and Z coordinates.
* `vy` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Y coordinate.
* `vz` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Z coordinate. To transform a 2D point, set Z to 1, and divide the result's X and Y by the result's Z.

#### Return Value

The transformed vector. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat3transpose'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat3transpose(m3)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat3transposeInPlace'></a>

#### Return Value

The parameter "mat". (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4copy'></a>

Return value. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4frustum'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4frustum(l, r, b, t, near, far)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing a <a href="tutorial-camera.md">perspective projection</a>
in the form of a view frustum, or the limits in the "camera"'s view.

When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, the X, Y, and Z coordinates within the
view volume (as is the case in WebGL) will range from -W to W (where W is the fourth
component of the transformed vertex). For a matrix in which Z coordinates
range from 0 to W, divide the 15th element of the result (zero-based index 14) by 2.

This method is designed for enabling a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">right-handed coordinate system</a>.
To adjust the result of this method for a left-handed system,
reverse the sign of the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th
elements of the result (zero-based indices 8, 9, 10, and 11).

#### Parameters

* `l` (Type: number)<br>X coordinate of the point in eye space where the left clipping plane meets the near clipping plane.
* `r` (Type: number)<br>X coordinate of the point in eye space where the right clipping plane meets the near clipping plane. ("l" is usually less than "r", so that X coordinates increase from left to right. If "l" is greater than "r", X coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `b` (Type: number)<br>Y coordinate of the point in eye space where the bottom clipping plane meets the near clipping plane.
* `t` (Type: number)<br>Y coordinate of the point in eye space where the top clipping plane meets the near clipping plane. ("b" is usually less than "t", so that Y coordinates increase upward, as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "b" is greater than "t", Y coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `near` (Type: number)<br>The distance, in eye space, from the "camera" to the near clipping plane. Objects closer than this distance won't be seen.

This value should be greater than 0, and should be set to the highest distance from the "camera" that the application can afford to clip out for being too close, for example, 0.5, 1, or higher.
* `far` (Type: number)<br>The distance, in eye space, from the "camera" to the far clipping plane. Objects farther than this distance won't be seen.<br>This value should be greater than 0 and should be set so that the absolute ratio of "far" to "near" is as small as the application can accept. ("near" is usually less than "far", so that Z coordinates increase from near to far in the direction from the back to the front of the "eye", as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "near" is greater than "far", Z coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)<br> In the usual case that "far" is greater than "near", depth buffer values will be more concentrated around the near plane than around the far plane due to the perspective projection. The greater the ratio of "far" to "near", the more concentrated the values will be around the near plane, and the more likely two objects close to the far plane will have identical depth values. (Most WebGL implementations support 24-bit depth buffers, meaning they support 16,777,216 possible values per pixel.)

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4identity'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4identity()

Returns the identity 4 &times; 4 matrix (a matrix that keeps
vectors unchanged when they are transformed with this matrix).

#### Return Value

Return value. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4inverseTranspose3'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4inverseTranspose3(m4)

Returns the transposed result of the inverted 3 &times; 3 upper left corner of
the given 4 &times; 4 matrix.

This is usually used to convert a model-view matrix (view matrix multiplied by model or world matrix) to a matrix
for transforming surface normals in order to keep them perpendicular
to a surface transformed by the model-view matrix. Normals are then
transformed by this matrix and then converted to <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vectors</a>. But if the
input matrix uses only rotations, translations, and/or uniform scaling
(same scaling in X, Y, and Z), the 3 &times; 3 upper left of the input matrix can
be used instead of the inverse-transpose matrix to transform the normals.

#### Parameters

* `m4` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 4 &times; 4 matrix.

#### Return Value

The resulting 3 &times; 3 matrix. If the matrix
can't be inverted, returns the identity 3 &times; 3 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4invert'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4invert(m)

#### Parameters

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix.
Returns the identity matrix if this matrix's determinant, or overall scaling factor, is 0 or extremely close to 0. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4isIdentity'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4isIdentity(mat)

Returns whether a 4 &times; 4 matrix is the identity matrix.

#### Parameters

* `mat` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 4 &times; 4 matrix.

#### Return Value

Return value. (Type: boolean)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4lookat'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4lookat(viewerPos, [lookingAt], [up])

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix that represents a camera view,
transforming world space coordinates, shared by every object in a scene, to coordinates in <i>eye space</i>
(also called <i>camera space</i> or <i>view space</i>). This essentially rotates a "camera"
and moves it to somewhere in the scene. In eye space:<ul>
<li>The "camera" is located at the origin (0,0,0), or
at <code>viewerPos</code> in world space,
and points away from the viewer toward the <code>lookingAt</code>
position in world space. This generally
puts <code>lookingAt</code> at the center of the view.
<li>The X axis points rightward from the "camera"'s viewpoint.
<li>The Y axis points upward from the center of the "camera" to its top. The
<code>up</code> vector guides this direction.
<li>The Z axis is parallel to the direction from the "camera"
to the <code>lookingAt</code> point.</ul>

This method is designed for use in a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">right-handed coordinate system</a>
(the Z axis's direction will be from the "camera" to the point looked at).
To adjust the result of this method for a left-handed system,
reverse the sign of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th,
13th, and 15th elements of the result (zero-based indices 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, and 14); the Z axis's direction will thus be from the point looked at to the "camera".

#### Parameters

* `viewerPos` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 3-element vector specifying the "camera" position in world space.<br> When used in conjunction with an orthographic projection, set this parameter to the value of <code>lookingAt</code> plus a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vector</a> (for example, using MathUtil.vec3add) to form an <i>axonometric projection</i> (if the unit vector is <code>[sqrt(1/3),sqrt(1/3),sqrt(1/3)]</code>, the result is an <i>isometric projection</i>). See the examples below.
* `lookingAt` (Type: Array.&lt;number>) (optional)<br>A 3-element vector specifying the point in world space that the "camera" is looking at. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is the coordinates (0,0,0).
* `up` (Type: Array.&lt;number>) (optional)<br>A 3-element vector specifying the direction from the center of the "camera" to its top. This parameter may be null or omitted, in which case the default is the vector (0, 1, 0), the vector that results when the "camera" is held upright.<br> This vector must not be parallel to the view direction (the direction from "viewerPos" to "lookingAt"). (See the example for one way to ensure this.)<br>

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

#### Examples

The following example calls this method with an
up vector of (0, 1, 0) except if the view direction is parallel to that
vector or nearly so.

    var upVector=[0,1,0]; // Y axis
    var viewdir=MathUtil.vec3sub(lookingAt, viewerPos);
    var par=MathUtil.vec3length(MathUtil.vec3cross(viewdir,upVector));
    if(par<0.00001)upVector=[0,0,1]; // view is almost parallel, so use Z axis
    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4lookat(viewerPos,lookingAt,upVector);

The following example creates an
isometric projection for a right-handed coordinate system. The Y
axis will point up, the Z axis toward the bottom left, and the X axis toward
the bottom right.

    // Assumes an orthographic projection matrix is used. Example:
    // var projectionMatrix=MathUtil.mat4ortho(-10,10,-10,10,-50,50);
    // Camera will be at (1,1,1) -- actually (sqrt(1/3),sqrt(1/3),sqrt(1/3)) --
    // and point toward [0,0,0]
    var lookPoint=[0,0,0];
    var cameraPoint=MathUtil.vec3normalize([1,1,1]);
    cameraPoint=MathUtil.vec3add(cameraPoint,lookPoint);
    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4lookat(cameraPoint,lookPoint);

The following example is like the previous
example, but with the Z axis pointing up.

    var lookPoint=[0,0,0];
    var cameraPoint=MathUtil.vec3normalize([1,1,1]);
    cameraPoint=MathUtil.vec3add(cameraPoint,lookPoint);
    // Positive Z axis is the up vector
    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4lookat(cameraPoint,lookPoint,[0,0,1]);

The following example creates a camera view matrix using the
viewer position, the viewing direction, and the up vector (a "look-to" matrix):

    var viewDirection=[0,0,1]
    var viewerPos=[0,0,0]
    var upVector=[0,1,0]
    var lookingAt=MathUtil.vec3add(viewerPos,viewDirection);
    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4lookat(viewerPos,lookingAt,upVector);

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4multiply'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4multiply(a, b)

Multiplies two 4 &times; 4 matrices. A new matrix is returned.
The matrices are multiplied such that the transformations
they describe happen in reverse order. For example, if the first
matrix (input matrix) describes a translation and the second
matrix describes a scaling, the multiplied matrix will describe
the effect of scaling then translation.

The matrix multiplication is effectively done by breaking up matrix <code>b</code>
into four 4-element vectors (the first 4 elements make up the first vector, and so on),
transforming each vector with
matrix <code>a</code>, and putting the vectors back together into a new matrix.

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first matrix.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second matrix.

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4oblique(alpha, phi)

coordinate systems.

#### Parameters

* `phi` (Type: number)<br>Controls the apparent angle of the negative Z axis in relation to the positive X axis. In degrees. 0 means the negative Z axis appears to point in the same direction as the positive X axis, and 90, in the same direction as the positive Y axis.

#### Return Value

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4ortho'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4ortho(l, r, b, t, n, f)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing an <a href="tutorial-camera.md">orthographic projection</a>.
In this projection, the left clipping plane is parallel to the right clipping
plane and the top to the bottom.

The projection returned by this method only scales and/or shifts the view, so that
objects with the same size won't appear smaller as they get more distant from the "camera".

When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, the X, Y, and Z coordinates within the
view volume (as is the case in WebGL) will range from -1 to 1.
For a matrix in which Z coordinates range from 0 to 1, divide the 11th and 15th elements
of the result (zero-based indices 10 and 14) by 2, then add 0.5 to the 15th element.

This method is designed for enabling a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">right-handed coordinate system</a>.
To adjust the result of this method for a left-handed system,
reverse the sign of the 11th element of the result (zero-based index 10).

#### Parameters

* `l` (Type: number)<br>Leftmost coordinate of the orthographic view.
* `r` (Type: number)<br>Rightmost coordinate of the orthographic view. ("l" is usually less than "r", so that X coordinates increase from left to right. If "l" is greater than "r", X coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `b` (Type: number)<br>Bottommost coordinate of the orthographic view.
* `t` (Type: number)<br>Topmost coordinate of the orthographic view. ("b" is usually less than "t", so that Y coordinates increase upward, as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "b" is greater than "t", Y coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `n` (Type: number)<br>Distance from the "camera" to the near clipping plane. A positive value means the plane is in front of the viewer.
* `f` (Type: number)<br>Distance from the "camera" to the far clipping plane. A positive value means the plane is in front of the viewer. ("n" is usually less than "f", so that Z coordinates increase from near to far in the direction from the back to the front of the "eye", as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "n" is greater than "f", Z coordinates increase in the opposite direction.) The absolute difference between n and f should be as small as the application can accept.

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

set to -1 and the far clipping plane set to 1.

This method is designed for enabling a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">right-handed coordinate system</a>.
See mat4ortho() for information on the meaning of coordinates

If the view rectangle's aspect ratio doesn't match the desired aspect
ratio, the view rectangle will be centered on the viewport

* `t` (Type: number)<br>Topmost coordinate of the orthographic view. ("b" is usually less than "t", so that Y coordinates increase upward, as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "b" is greater than "t", Y coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `n` (Type: number)<br>Distance from the "camera" to the near clipping plane. A positive value means the plane is in front of the viewer.
* `f` (Type: number)<br>Distance from the "camera" to the far clipping plane. A positive value means the plane is in front of the viewer. ("n" is usually less than "f", so that Z coordinates increase from near to far in the direction from the back to the front of the "eye", as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "n" is greater than "f", Z coordinates increase in the opposite direction.) The absolute difference between n and f should be as small as the application can accept.

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4perspective'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4perspective(fovY, aspectRatio, near, far)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing a <a href="tutorial-camera.md">perspective projection</a>.

When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, the X, Y, and Z coordinates within the
view volume (as is the case in WebGL) will range from -W to W (where W is the fourth
component of the transformed vertex) and
increase from left to right and bottom to top. For a matrix in which Z coordinates
range from 0 to W, divide the 15th element of the result (zero-based index 14) by 2.

This method is designed for enabling a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">right-handed coordinate system</a>.
To adjust the result of this method for a left-handed system,
reverse the sign of the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th
elements of the result (zero-based indices 8, 9, 10, and 11).

#### Parameters

* `fovY` (Type: number)<br>Y axis field of view, in degrees, that is, the shortest angle between the top and bottom clipping planes. Should be less than 180 degrees. (The smaller this number, the bigger close objects appear to be. As a result, zooming out can be implemented by raising this value, and zooming in by lowering it.)
* `aspectRatio` (Type: number)<br>The ratio of width to height of the viewport, usually the scene's aspect ratio.
* `near` (Type: number)<br>The distance, in eye space, from the "camera" to the near clipping plane. Objects closer than this distance won't be seen.

This value should be greater than 0, and should be set to the highest distance from the "camera" that the application can afford to clip out for being too close, for example, 0.5, 1, or higher.
* `far` (Type: number)<br>The distance, in eye space, from the "camera" to the far clipping plane. Objects farther than this distance won't be seen.<br>This value should be greater than 0 and should be set so that the absolute ratio of "far" to "near" is as small as the application can accept. ("near" is usually less than "far", so that Z coordinates increase from near to far in the direction from the back to the front of the "eye", as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "near" is greater than "far", Z coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)<br> In the usual case that "far" is greater than "near", depth buffer values will be more concentrated around the near plane than around the far plane due to the perspective projection. The greater the ratio of "far" to "near", the more concentrated the values will be around the near plane, and the more likely two objects close to the far plane will have identical depth values. (Most WebGL implementations support 24-bit depth buffers, meaning they support 16,777,216 possible values per pixel.)

When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, the X, Y, and Z coordinates within the
view volume (as is the case in WebGL) will range from -W to W (where W is the fourth
component of the transformed vertex) and
increase from left to right and bottom to top. For a matrix in which Z coordinates
range from 0 to W, divide the 15th element of the result (zero-based index 14) by 2.

* `aspectRatio` (Type: number)<br>The ratio of width to height of the viewport, usually the scene's aspect ratio.
* `near` (Type: number)<br>The distance, in eye space, from the "camera" to the near clipping plane. Objects closer than this distance won't be seen.

This value should be greater than 0, and should be set to the highest distance from the "camera" that the application can afford to clip out for being too close, for example, 0.5, 1, or higher.

Transforms a 3-element vector with a 4 &times; 4 matrix and returns
a perspective-correct version of the vector as a 3D point.

The transformation involves transforming a 4-element vector with the same X,
Y, and Z coordinates, but with a W coordinate equal to 1, with the 4 &times; 4 matrix, and
then dividing X, Y, and Z of the transformed 4-element
vector by that vector's W (a <i>perspective divide</i>),
then returning that vector's new X, Y, and Z.

#### Parameters

Finds the six clipping planes of a view frustum defined
by a 4 &times; 4 matrix. These six planes together form the
shape of a "chopped-off" pyramid (or frustum).

In this model, the eye, or camera, is placed at the top

### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4transform(mat, v, [vy], [vz], [vw])

Transforms a 4-element vector with a 4 &times; 4 matrix and returns
the transformed vector.

Transforming a vector (<code>v</code>) with a matrix (<code>mat</code>)
is effectively done by breaking up <code>mat</code> into four 4-element vectors
(the first 4 elements make up the first vector, and so on), multiplying
each vector in <code>mat</code> by the corresponding component in
<code>v</code>, and adding up the resulting vectors (except <code>v</code>) to
get the transformed vector.

#### Parameters

* `mat` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 4 &times; 4 matrix.
* `v` (Type: Array.&lt;number> | number)<br>X coordinate. If "vy", "vz", and "vw" are omitted, this value can instead be a 4-element array giving the X, Y, Z, and W coordinates.
* `vy` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Y coordinate.
* `vz` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Z coordinate.
* `vw` (Type: number) (optional)<br>W coordinate. To transform a 3D point, set W to 1 and divide the result's X, Y, and Z by the result's W. To transform a 2D point, set Z to 0 and W to 1 and divide the result's X and Y by the result's W.

#### Return Value

The transformed vector. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.mat4transformVec3'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4transformVec3(mat, v, [vy], [vz])

Transforms a 3-element vector with a 4 &times; 4 matrix as though it were
an affine transformation matrix (without perspective) and returns the transformed vector.
The effect is as though elements
3, 7, 11, and 15 (counting from 0) of the matrix
were assumed to be (0, 0, 0, 1) instead of their actual values and as though the 3-element
vector had a fourth element valued at 1.

For most purposes, use
the MathUtil.mat4projectVec3 method instead, which supports
4 &times; 4 matrices that may be in a perspective
projection (whose last row is not necessarily (0, 0, 0, 1)).

#### Parameters

* `mat` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 4 &times; 4 matrix.
* `v` (Type: Array.&lt;number> | number)<br>X coordinate. If "vy" and "vz" are omitted, this value can instead be a 4-element array giving the X, Y, and Z coordinates.
* `vy` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Y coordinate.
* `vz` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Z coordinate. To transform a 2D point, set Z to 0.

* `v3y` (Type: number)<br>Translation along the Y axis.
* `v3z` (Type: number)<br>Translation along the Z axis.

#### Return Value

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.quatMultiply'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.quatMultiply(a, b)

Multiplies two quaternions, creating a composite rotation.
The quaternions are multiplied such that the second quaternion's
rotation happens before the first quaternion's rotation when applied
in the global coordinate frame.

If both quaternions are <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vectors</a>, the resulting
quaternion will also be a unit vector. However, for best results, you should
normalize the quaternions every few multiplications (using
MathUtil.quatNormalize or MathUtil.quatNormalizeInPlace), since successive
multiplications can cause rounding errors.

Quaternion multiplication is not commutative except in the last component
of the resulting quaternion, since the definition of quaternion multiplication
includes taking a cross product of <code>a</code>'s and <code>b</code>'s first three components,
in that order, and the cross product is not commutative (see also MathUtil.vec3cross).

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first quaternion.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second quaternion.

#### Return Value

The resulting quaternion. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.quatNlerp'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.quatNlerp(q1, q2, factor)

Returns a quaternion that lies along the shortest path between the
given two quaternion rotations, using a linear interpolation function, and converts
it to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vector</a>.
This is called a normalized linear interpolation, or "nlerp".

Because the shortest path is curved, not straight, this method
will generally not interpolate at constant velocity;
however, the difference in this velocity when interpolating is
rarely noticeable and this method is generally faster than
the MathUtil.quatSlerp method.

#### Parameters

* `q1` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first quaternion. Must be a unit vector.
* `q2` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second quaternion. Must be a unit vector.
* `factor` (Type: number)<br>A value that usually ranges from 0 through 1. Closer to 0 means closer to q1, and closer to 1 means closer to q2.

#### Return Value

The interpolated quaternion,
which will be a unit vector. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.quatNormalize'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.quatNormalize(quat)

When a quaternion is normalized, the distance from the origin
to that quaternion becomes 1 (unless all its components are 0).
A quaternion is normalized by dividing each of its components
by its length.

#### Parameters

* `quat` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A quaternion, containing four elements.

#### Return Value

The normalized quaternion.
Note that due to rounding error, the vector's length might not be exactly equal to 1, and that the vector will remain unchanged if its length is 0 or extremely close to 0. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

#### See Also

MathUtil.vec4normalize

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.quatNormalizeInPlace'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.quatNormalizeInPlace(quat)

to that quaternion becomes 1 (unless all its components are 0).
A quaternion is normalized by dividing each of its components
by its length.

#### Parameters

* `quat` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A quaternion, containing four elements.

#### Return Value

The parameter "quat".
Note that due to rounding error, the vector's length might not be exactly equal to 1, and that the vector will remain unchanged if its length is 0 or extremely close to 0. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

#### See Also

MathUtil.vec4normalizeInPlace

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.quatRotate'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.quatRotate(quat, angle, v, vy, vz)

Multiplies a quaternion by a rotation transformation that rotates vectors
by the given rotation angle and around the given <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">axis of rotation</a>.
The result is such that the angle-axis
rotation happens before the quaternion's rotation when applied
in the global coordinate frame.

This method is equivalent to the following (see also MathUtil.quatMultiply):

    return quatMultiply(quat,quatFromAxisAngle(angle,v,vy,vz));

#### Parameters

* `quat` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>Quaternion to rotate.
* `angle` (Type: Array.&lt;number> | number)<br>The desired angle to rotate in degrees. If "v", "vy", and "vz" are omitted, this can instead be a 4-element array giving the axis of rotation as the first three elements, followed by the angle in degrees as the fourth element.
* `v` (Type: Array.&lt;number> | number)<br>X-component of the point lying on the axis of rotation. If "vy" and "vz" are omitted, this can instead be a 3-element array giving the axis of rotation.
* `vy` (Type: number)<br>Y-component of the point lying on the axis of rotation.
* `vz` (Type: number)<br>Z-component of the point lying on the axis of rotation.

#### Return Value

The parameter "a". (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.quatSlerp'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.quatSlerp(q1, q2, factor)

Returns a quaternion that lies along the shortest path between the
given two quaternion rotations, using a spherical interpolation function.
This is called spherical linear interpolation, or "slerp". (A spherical
interpolation finds the shortest angle between the two quaternions -- which
are treated as 4D vectors -- and then finds a vector with a smaller angle
between it and the first quaternion. The "factor" parameter specifies
how small the new angle will be relative to the original angle.)

This method will generally interpolate at constant velocity; however,
this method is not commutative (that is, the order in which the quaternions are given
matters), unlike quatNlerp, making it
unsuitable for blending multiple quaternion rotations,
and this method is generally more computationally expensive
than the quatNlerp method.

#### Parameters

* `q1` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first quaternion. Must be a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vector</a>.
* `q2` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second quaternion. Must be a unit vector.
* `factor` (Type: number)<br>A value that usually ranges from 0 through 1. Closer to 0 means closer to q1, and closer to 1 means closer to q2.

#### Return Value

The interpolated quaternion. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

This is one of the Math constants such as MathUtil.LocalPitchYawRoll and MathUtil.GlobalYawRollPitch. If null, undefined, or omitted, the default is MathUtil.GlobalRollPitchYaw. The constants starting with <code>Global</code> describe a vector rotation in the order given, each about the original axes (these angles are also called <i>extrinsic</i> angles). The constants starting with <code>Local</code> describe a vector rotation in the order given, where the second and third rotations occur around the rotated object's new axes and not necessarily the original axes (these angles are also called <i>intrinsic</i> angles). The order of <code>Local</code> rotations has the same result as the reversed order of <code>Global</code> rotations and vice versa.

#### Return Value

pitch, yaw, and roll angles (X, Y, and Z axis angles), in that order and in degrees, by which to rotate vectors.
See "Axis of Rotation" in "<a href="tutorial-glmath.md">H3DU's Math Functions</a>" for the meaning of each angle. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

Negates a 2-element vector in place, generally resulting in a vector with
the same length but opposite direction.
Negating a vector
is the same as reversing the sign of each of its components.

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 2-element vector.

#### Return Value

The parameter "a". (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.vec2normalize'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec2normalize(vec)

Converts a 2-element vector to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vector</a>; returns a new vector.
When a vector is normalized, its direction remains the same but the distance from the origin
to that vector becomes 1 (unless all its components are 0).
A vector is normalized by dividing each of its components
by its length.

#### Parameters

* `vec` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 2-element vector.

#### Return Value

The resulting vector.
Note that due to rounding error, the vector's length might not be exactly equal to 1, and that the vector will remain unchanged if its length is 0 or extremely close to 0. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

#### Examples

The following example changes the
length of a line segment.

    var startPt=[x1,y1]; // Line segment's start
    var endPt=[x2,y2]; // Line segment's end
    // Find difference between endPt and startPt
    var delta=MathUtil.vec2sub(endPt,startPt);
    // Normalize delta to a unit vector
    var deltaNorm=MathUtil.vec2normalize(delta);
    // Rescale to the desired length, here, 10
    MathUtil.vec2scaleInPlace(deltaNorm,10);
    // Find the new endpoint
    endPt=MathUtil.vec2add(startPt,deltaNorm);

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.vec3cross'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3cross(a, b)

Finds the cross product of two 3-element vectors (called A and B).
The following are properties of the cross product:<ul>
<li>The cross product will be a vector that is <i>orthogonal</i> (perpendicular) to both A and B.
<li>Switching the order of A and B results in a cross product
vector with the same length but opposite direction. (Thus, the cross product is not <i>commutative</i>,
but it is <i>anticommutative</i>.)
<li>Let there be a triangle formed by point A, point B, and the point (0,0,0) in that order.
While the cross product of A and B points toward the viewer,
the triangle's vertices are oriented counterclockwise for <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">right-handed coordinate systems</a>,
or clockwise for left-handed systems. The triangle's area is half of the cross product's length.
<li>The length of the cross
product equals |<b>a</b>| &#x2a; |<b>b</b>| &#x2a; |sin &theta;|
where |<b>x</b>| is the length of vector <b>x</b>, and
&theta; is the shortest angle between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.
It follows that:<ul>
<li>If the length is 0, then A and B are parallel vectors (0 or 180 degrees apart).
<li>If A and B are <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vectors</a>, the length equals the absolute value
of the sine of the shortest angle between A and B.
<li>If A and B are unit vectors, the cross product will be a unit vector only if A is perpendicular
to B (the shortest angle between A and B will be 90 degrees, since sin 90&deg; = 1).
</ul></ul>
The cross product (<b>c</b>) of vectors <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> is found as
follows:<br>
<b>c</b>.x = <b>a</b>.y &#x2a; <b>b</b>.z - <b>a</b>.z &#x2a; <b>b</b>.y<br>
<b>c</b>.y = <b>a</b>.z &#x2a; <b>b</b>.x - <b>a</b>.x &#x2a; <b>b</b>.z<br>
<b>c</b>.z = <b>a</b>.x &#x2a; <b>b</b>.y - <b>a</b>.y &#x2a; <b>b</b>.x<br>

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first 3-element vector.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second 3-element vector.

#### Return Value

A 3-element vector containing the cross product. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

#### Examples

The following example uses the cross product to
calculate a triangle's normal vector and its area.

    var a=triangle[0];
    var b=triangle[1];
    var c=triangle[2];
    // Find vector from C to A
    var da=MathUtil.vec3sub(a,c);
    // Find vector from C to B
    var db=MathUtil.vec3sub(b,c);
    // The triangle's normal is the cross product of da and db
    var normal=MathUtil.vec3cross(da,db);
    // Find the triangle's area
    var area=MathUtil.vec3length(normal)*0.5;

The following example finds the cosine and sine of
the angle between two unit vectors and the orthogonal unit vector of both.

    var cr=MathUtil.vec3cross(unitA,unitB);
    // Cosine of the angle. Will be positive or negative depending on
    // the shortest angle between the vectors.
    var cosine=MathUtil.vec3dot(unitA,unitB);
    // Sine of the angle. Note that the sine will always be 0 or greater because
    // the shortest angle between them is positive or 0 degrees.
    var sine=MathUtil.vec3length(cr);

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.vec3dist'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3dist(vecFrom, vecTo)

to another, treating both as 3D points.

#### Parameters

* `vecFrom` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first 3-element vector.

#### Return Value

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.vec3dot'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3dot(a, b)

Finds the dot product of two 3-element vectors. It's the
sum of the products of their components (for example, <b>a</b>'s X times
<b>b</b>'s X).

The following are properties of the dot product:
<ul>
<li>The dot
product equals |<b>a</b>| &#x2a; |<b>b</b>| &#x2a; cos &theta;
where |<b>x</b>| is the length of vector <b>x</b>, and
&theta; is the shortest angle between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.
It follows that:<ul>
<li>A dot product of 0 indicates that the vectors are 90
degrees apart, making them <i>orthogonal</i>
(perpendicular to each other).
<li>A dot product greater than 0 means less than 90 degrees apart.
<li>A dot product less than 0 means greater than 90 degrees apart.
<li>If both vectors are <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vectors</a>, the cosine
of the shortest angle between them is equal to their dot product.
However, <code>Math.acos</code> won't return a negative angle
from that cosine, so the dot product can't
be used to determine if one vector is "ahead of" or "behind" another
vector.
<li>If both vectors are unit vectors, a dot product of 1 or -1 indicates
that the two vectors are parallel (and the vectors are 0 or
180 degrees apart, respectively.)
<li>If one of the vectors is a unit vector, the dot product's absolute
value will be the length that vector must have to make the closest
approach to the other vector's endpoint. If the dot product is negative,
the unit vector must also be in the opposite direction to approach the
other vector's endpoint.
</ul></li>
<li>If the two vectors are the same, the return value indicates
the vector's length squared. This is illustrated in the example.
<li>Switching the order of the two vectors results in the
same dot product. (Thus, the dot product is <i>commutative</i>.)
</ul>

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first 3-element vector.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second 3-element vector.

#### Return Value

A number representing the dot product. (Type: number)

#### Examples

The following shows a fast way to compare
a vector's length using the dot product.

    // Check if the vector's length squared is less than 20 units squared
    if(MathUtil.vec3dot(vector, vector)<20*20) {
    // The vector's length is shorter than 20 units
    }

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.vec3fromWindowPoint'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3fromWindowPoint(vector, matrix, viewport, [yUp])

Unprojects the <i>window coordinates</i> given in a
3-element vector,
using the given transformation matrix and viewport
rectangle.

In the window coordinate space, X coordinates increase
rightward and Y coordinates increase upward
or downward depending on the "yUp" parameter, and
Z coordinates within the view volume range from 0 to 1 and
increase from front to back.

#### Parameters

* `vector` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 3-element vector giving the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the 3D point to transform, in window coordinates.
* `matrix` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 4 &times; 4 matrix. After undoing the transformation to window coordinates, the vector will be transformed by the inverse of this matrix according to the MathUtil.mat4projectVec3 method.<br> To convert to world space, this parameter will generally be a projection-view matrix (projection matrix multiplied by the view matrix, in that order). To convert to object (model) space, this parameter will generally be a model-view-projection matrix (projection-view matrix multiplied by the world [model] matrix, in that order). See MathUtil.vec3toWindowPoint for the meaning of window coordinates with respect to the "matrix" and "yUp" parameters.
* `viewport` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 4-element array specifying the starting position and size of the viewport in window units (such as pixels). In order, the four elements are the starting position's X coordinate, its Y coordinate, the viewport's width, and the viewport's height. Throws an error if the width or height is less than 0.
* `yUp` (Type: boolean) (optional)<br>If omitted or a "falsy" value, reverses the sign of the Y coordinate returned by the MathUtil.mat4projectVec3 method before converting it to window coordinates. If true, the Y coordinate will remain unchanged. If window Y coordinates increase upward, the viewport's starting position is at the lower left corner. If those coordinates increase downward, the viewport's starting position is at the upper left corner.

#### Return Value

A 3-element array giving the coordinates
of the unprojected point, in that order. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.vec3length'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3length(a)

Returns the distance of this 3-element vector from the origin,
also known as its <i>length</i> or <i>magnitude</i>.
It's the same as the square root of the sum of the squares
of its components.

Note that if vectors are merely sorted or compared by their lengths (and
those lengths are not added or multiplied together or the like),
it's faster to sort or compare them by the squares of their lengths (to find
the square of a 3-element vector's length, call MathUtil.vec3dot
passing the same vector as both of its arguments).

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 3-element vector.

#### Return Value

Return value. (Type: number)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.vec3lerp'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3lerp(v1, v2, factor)

Does a linear interpolation between two 3-element vectors;
returns a new vector.

#### Parameters

* `v1` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first vector to interpolate. The interpolation will occur on each component of this vector and v2.
* `v2` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second vector to interpolate.
* `factor` (Type: number)<br>A value that usually ranges from 0 through 1. Closer to 0 means closer to v1, and closer to 1 means closer to v2.<br>For a nonlinear interpolation, define a function that takes a value that usually ranges from 0 through 1 and returns a value generally ranging from 0 through 1, and pass the result of that function to this method.<br> The following are examples of interpolation functions. See also the code examples following this list.<ul> <li>Linear: <code>factor</code>. Constant speed. <li>Powers: <code>Math.pow(factor, N)</code>, where N &gt; 0. For example, N=2 means a square, N=3 means cube, N=1/2 means square root, and N=1/3 means cube root. If N &gt; 1, this function starts slow and ends fast. If N &lt; 1, this function starts fast and ends slow. <li>Sine: <code>Math.sin(Math.PI\*0.5\*factor)</code>. This function starts fast and ends slow. <li>Smoothstep: <code>(3.0-2.0\*factor)\*factor\*factor</code>. This function starts and ends slow, and speeds up in the middle. <li>Perlin's "Smootherstep": <code>(10+factor\*(factor\*6-15))\*factor\*factor\*factor</code>. This function starts and ends slow, and speeds up in the middle. <li>Discrete-step timing, where N is a number of steps greater than 0:<ul> <li>Position start: <code>factor &lt; 0 ? 0 : Math.max(1.0,(1.0+Math.floor(factor\*N))/N)</code>.</li> <li>Position end: <code>Math.floor(factor\*N)/N</code>.</li></ul> <li>Inverted interpolation: <code>1.0-INTF(1.0-factor)</code>, where <code>INTF(x)</code> is another interpolation function. This function reverses the speed behavior; for example, a function that started fast now starts slow. <li>Ease: <code>factor &lt; 0.5 ? INTF(factor\*2)\*0.5 : 1.0-(INTF((1.0-factor)\*2)\*0.5)</code>, where <code>INTF(x)</code> is another interpolation function. Depending on the underlying function, this function eases in, then eases out, or vice versa. </ul>

#### Return Value

The interpolated vector. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

#### Examples

The following code does a nonlinear
interpolation of two vectors that uses the cube of "factor" rather than
"factor". Rather than at a constant speed, the vectors are interpolated
slowly then very fast.

    factor = factor*factor*factor; // cube the interpolation factor
    var newVector = MathUtil.vec3lerp(vector1, vector2, factor);

The following code does an inverted cubic
interpolation. This time, vectors are interpolated fast then very slowly.

    factor = 1 - factor; // Invert the factor
    factor = factor*factor*factor; // cube the interpolation factor
    factor = 1 - factor; // Invert the result
    var newVector = MathUtil.vec3lerp(vector1, vector2, factor);

The following code does the nonlinear
 interpolation called "smoothstep". It slows down at the beginning
and end, and speeds up in the middle.

    factor = (3.0-2.0*factor)*factor*factor; // smoothstep interpolation
    var newVector = MathUtil.vec3lerp(vector1, vector2, factor);

length of a line segment.

coordinates, in that order. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='H3DU.MathUtil.vec3triple'></a>
### (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3triple(a, b, c)

Finds the scalar triple product of three vectors (A, B, and C). The triple
product is the dot product of both A and the
cross product
of B and C. The following are properties of the scalar triple product
(called triple product in what follows):<ul>
<li>Switching the order of B and C, A and C, or A and B results in a triple product
with its sign reversed. Moving all three parameters to different positions, though,
results in the same triple product.
<li>The triple product's absolute value is the volume of a parallelepiped (skewed
box) where three of its sides having a vertex in common are
defined by A, B, and C, in any order.
<li>The triple product's absolute value divided by 6 is the volume of a tetrahedron,
where three of its sides having a vertex in common are
defined by A, B, and C, in any order.
<li>If the triple product is 0, all three vectors lie on the same plane (are <i>coplanar</i>).
<li>The triple product is the same as the <i>determinant</i> (overall scaling factor)
of a 3 &times; 3 matrix whose rows or columns are the vectors A, B, and C, in that order.
<li>Assume A is perpendicular to vectors B and C. If the triple product is positive,
then A points in the same direction as the cross product of
B and C -- which will be perpendicular -- and the angle from B to C, when rotated
about vector A, is positive. If the triple product is negative, then A points in the
opposite direction from that cross product, and that angle is negative.
(See the example below.)
</ul>

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first 3-element vector.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second 3-element vector, or the first parameter to the cross product.
