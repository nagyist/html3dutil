## Introduction

This page describes conventions for specifying projection and
view transforms in 3D graphics, especially when using my
[**Geometry Utilities Library**](http://peteroupc.github.io/html3dutil),
and explains how a commonly used graphics pipeline transforms vertices to help
it draw triangles, lines, and other graphics primitives.

**Source code for the latest version of the library is available at the** [**Geometry Utilities Library's project page**](https://github.com/peteroupc/html3dutil)**.**

### Overview of Transformations

Most modern 3D rendering engines use the following transformations:

* A _world matrix_ transforms an object's own coordinates to _world space_,
the coordinate system shared by every object in the scene. The world matrix
is not discussed in this page.
* A _view matrix_ transforms coordinates in world space to _eye space_.
* A _projection matrix_ transforms coordinates in eye space to _clip space_.  If we use the concept of a "camera", the projection matrix is like setting the "camera"'s focus and lens, and the view matrix is like setting its position and orientation.

As [**explained later**](#Vertex Coordinates in the Graphics System) on this page,
however, these transformations and matrices are
merely for the convenience of the rendering engine; all the graphics pipeline expects is the clip
space coordinates of the things it draws. The pipeline uses those coordinates
and their transformed _window coordinates_ when rendering things on the screen.

## Projection Transform

A _projection transform_ (usually in the form of a _projection matrix_) transforms coordinates in eye space to _clip space_.

Two commonly used projections in 3D graphics are the perspective projection and
orthographic projection, described below. (Other kinds of projections, such as oblique projections, isometric projections, and nonlinear projection functions, are not treated here.)

<a id=Perspective_Projection></a>

### Perspective Projection

A perspective projection gives the 3D scene a sense of depth. In this projection, closer objects look bigger than more distant objects with the same size, making the projection similar to how our eyes see the world.

![**Two rows of spheres, and a drawing of a perspective view volume.**](persp1.png)

![**Two rows of spheres, and a side drawing of a perspective view volume.**](persp2.png)

The 3D scene is contained in a so-called _view volume_, and only objects contained in the
view volume will be visible. The lines above show what a perspective view
volume looks like. Some of the spheres drawn would not be visible within this view volume,
and others would be.

The view volume is bounded on all six sides by six _clipping planes_:

* The near and far clipping planes are placed a certain distance from the "camera". For example, if the near clipping plane is 3 units away and the far clipping plane is 5 units away, the view volume will hold only objects between 3 and 5 units from the "camera". (Strictly speaking, a near clipping plane is not necessary, but practically speaking it is, in order to make the math work out correctly.)
* The left, right, top, and bottom clipping planes form the other four sides of the volume.

Note further that:

* The angle separating the top and bottom clipping planes is the projection's _field of view_. This angle is similar to the aperture of a camera. The greater the vertical field of view, the greater the vertical visibility range.
* In a perspective projection, the view volume will resemble a "pyramid" with the top chopped off (a _frustum_). The near clipping plane will be located at the chopped-off top, and the far clipping plane will be at the base.

The perspective projection converts 3D coordinates to 4-element vectors in _clip space_. However, this is not the whole story, since in general, lines that are parallel in world space will not appear parallel in a perspective projection, so additional math is needed to achieve the perspective effect. This will be [**explained later**](#Vertex Coordinates in the Graphics System).

The following methods define a perspective projection.

**[`MathUtil.mat4perspective(fov, aspect, near, far)`]{@link MathUtil.mat4perspective}**

This method returns a 4x4 matrix that adjusts the coordinate system for a perspective
projection given a field of view and an aspect ratio,
and sets the scene's projection matrix accordingly.

* `fov` - Vertical field of view, in degrees.
* `aspect` - Aspect ratio of the scene.
* `near`, `far` - Distance from the "camera" to the near and far clipping planes.

**[**`MathUtil.mat4frustum(left, right, bottom, top, near, far)`**](http://peteroupc.github.io/html3dutil/MathUtil.html#.mat4frustum)**

This method returns a 4x4 matrix that adjusts the coordinate system for a perspective
projection based on the location of the six clipping planes that
bound the view volume. Their positions are chosen so that the result is a perspective projection.

* `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `top` - Location of the left, right, bottom, and top clipping planes in terms
of where they meet the near clipping plane.
* `near`, `far` - Distance from the "camera" to the near and far clipping planes.

<a id=Orthographic_Projection></a>

### Orthographic Projection

An orthographic projection is one in which the left and right clipping planes are parallel to each other,
and the top and bottom clipping planes are parallel to each other. This results in the near and far clipping
planes having the same size, unlike in a perspective projection, and
objects with the same size not varying in size with their distance from the "camera".

The following methods generate an orthographic projection.

**`MathUtil.mat4ortho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far)`**

This method returns a 4x4 matrix that adjusts the coordinate system for an orthographic projection.

* `left` - Leftmost coordinate of the 3D view.
* `right` - Rightmost coordinate of the 3D view.
* `bottom` - Topmost coordinate of the 3D view.
* `top` - Bottommost coordinate of the 3D view.
* `near`, `far` - Distance from the "camera" to the near and far clipping planes. Either value
can be negative.

**`MathUtil.mat4ortho2d(left, right, bottom, top)`**

This method returns a 4x4 matrix that adjusts the coordinate system for a two-dimensional orthographic projection. This is a convenience method that is useful for showing a two-dimensional view.  The `mat4ortho2d` method calls `mat4ortho` and sets `near` and `far` to -1 and 1, respectively. This choice of values makes Z coordinates at or near 0 especially appropriate for this projection.

* `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `top` - Same as in `mat4ortho`.

**`MathUtil.mat4orthoAspect(left, right, bottom, top, near, far, aspect)`**

This method returns a 4x4 matrix that adjusts the coordinate system for an orthographic projection,
such that the resulting view isn't stretched
or squished in case the view volume's aspect ratio and the scene's aspect ratio are different.

* `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `top`, `near`, `far` - Same as in `setOrtho`.
* `aspect` - Aspect ratio of the viewport.

<a id=View_Transform></a>

## View Transform

The view matrix transforms _world space_ coordinates, shared by every object in a scene, to coordinates in _eye space_
(also called _camera space_ or _view space_), in which the "camera" is located at the center of the coordinate system: (0, 0, 0).
A view matrix essentially rotates the "camera" and moves it to a given position in world space. Specifically:

* The "camera" is rotated to point at a certain object or location on the scene. This is represented by
the `lookingAt` parameter in the `mat4lookat()` method, below.
* The "camera" is placed somewhere on the scene. This is represented by
the `eye` parameter in the `mat4lookat()` method.  It also represents the "eye position" in the perspective
projection, above.
* The "camera" rolls itself, possibly turning it sideways or upside down. This is guided by
the `up` parameter in the `mat4lookat()` method. Turning the "camera" upside down, for example, will swap
the placement of the top and bottom clipping planes, thus inverting the view of the scene.

**`MathUtil.mat4lookat(eye, lookingAt, up)`**

This method allows you to generate a view matrix based on the "camera"'s position and view.

* `eye` - Array of three elements (X, Y, Z) giving the position of the "camera" in world space.
* `lookingAt` - Array of three elements (X, Y, Z) giving the position the "camera" is looking at in world space.
This is optional. The default is [0, 0, 0].
* `up` - Array of three elements (X, Y, Z) giving the vector from the center of the "camera" to the top.
This is optional. The default is [0, 1, 0].

## Vertex Coordinates in the Graphics System

The concepts of _eye space_, _camera space_, and _world space_, as well as
the use of matrices related to them, such as _projection_, _view_, _model-view_,
and _world_ matrices, are merely conventions,
which exist for convenience in many 3D graphics libraries.

When a commonly used graphics pipeline (outside of the 3D graphics library concerned) draws a triangle, line, or point,
all it really expects is the location of that primitive's vertices in _clip space_. A
so-called _vertex shader_ communicates those locations to the graphics pipeline using
the data accessible to it. Although the vertex shader can use projection, view, and world
matrices to help the pipeline find a vertex's clip space coordinates, it doesn't have to,
and can use a different paradigm for this purpose. For example, the vertex shader can
be passed vertex coordinates that are already in clip space and just output those coordinates
without transforming them.

As the name suggests, clip space coordinates are used for clipping primitives to the
screen. Each clip space vertex is in _homogeneous coordinates_, consisting of an
X, Y, Z, and W coordinate, where the X, Y, and Z are premultiplied by the W. The
perspective matrix returned by {@link MathUtil.mat4perspective}, for example,
transforms W to the negative Z coordinate in eye space, that is, it will increase with
the distance to the coordinates from the "eye" or "camera".

To take perspective into account, the clip space X, Y, and Z coordinates are
divided by the clip space W, and then converted to _window coordinates_,
which roughly correspond to screen pixels. The window coordinates
will have the same range as the current _viewport_. A viewport is a rectangle
whose size and position are generally expressed in pixels.

For the perspective matrix returned by [`mat4perspective`]{@link MathUtil.mat4perspective}, dividing
the X, Y, and Z coordinates by the clip space W results in the effect that as W gets
higher and higher (and farther and farther from the "eye" or "camera"),
the X, Y, and Z coordinates are brought closer and closer to the center of the view.  This
is the _perspective_ effect mentioned earlier: objects will appear smaller and smaller
as they are more and more distant from the "camera".
