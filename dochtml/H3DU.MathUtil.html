<p>The matrix multiplication is effectively done by breaking up matrix <code>b</code>

When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, the X, Y, and Z coordinates within the
view volume (as is the case in WebGL) will range from -W to W (where W is the fourth
component of the transformed vertex). For a matrix in which Z coordinates
range from 0 to W, divide the 15th element of the result (zero-based index 14) by 2.<p>
This method is designed for enabling a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">right-handed coordinate system</a>.
To adjust the result of this method for a left-handed system,
reverse the sign of the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th
elements of the result (zero-based indices 8, 9, 10, and 11).<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>l</code> (Type: number)<br>X coordinate of the point in eye space where the left clipping plane meets the near clipping plane.<li><code>r</code> (Type: number)<br>X coordinate of the point in eye space where the right clipping plane meets the near clipping plane. ("l" is usually less than "r", so that X coordinates increase from left to right. If "l" is greater than "r", X coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)<li><code>b</code> (Type: number)<br>Y coordinate of the point in eye space where the bottom clipping plane meets the near clipping plane.<li><code>t</code> (Type: number)<br>Y coordinate of the point in eye space where the top clipping plane meets the near clipping plane. ("b" is usually less than "t", so that Y coordinates increase upward, as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "b" is greater than "t", Y coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)<li><code>near</code> (Type: number)<br>The distance, in eye space, from the "camera" to the near clipping plane. Objects closer than this distance won't be seen.<p>This value should be greater than 0, and should be set to the highest distance from the "camera" that the application can afford to clip out for being too close, for example, 0.5, 1, or higher.<li><code>far</code> (Type: number)<br>The distance, in eye space, from the "camera" to the far clipping plane. Objects farther than this distance won't be seen.<br>This value should be greater than 0 and should be set so that the absolute ratio of "far" to "near" is as small as the application can accept. ("near" is usually less than "far", so that Z coordinates increase from near to far in the direction from the back to the front of the "eye", as they do in WebGL when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "near" is greater than "far", Z coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)<br> In the usual case that "far" is greater than "near", depth buffer values will be more concentrated around the near plane than around the far plane due to the perspective projection. The greater the ratio of "far" to "near", the more concentrated the values will be around the near plane, and the more likely two objects close to the far plane will have identical depth values. (Most WebGL implementations support 24-bit depth buffers, meaning they support 16,777,216 possible values per pixel.)</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix.

<h3> (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4inverseTranspose3(m4)</h3>Returns the transposed result of the inverted 3 &times; 3 upper left corner of

This is usually used to convert a model-view matrix (view matrix multiplied by model or world matrix) to a matrix
for transforming surface normals in order to keep them perpendicular
to a surface transformed by the model-view matrix. Normals are then
transformed by this matrix and then converted to <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vectors</a>. But if the
input matrix uses only rotations, translations, and/or uniform scaling
(same scaling in X, Y, and Z), the 3 &times; 3 upper left of the input matrix can
be used instead of the inverse-transpose matrix to transform the normals.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>m4</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 4 &times; 4 matrix.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The resulting 3 &times; 3 matrix. If the matrix

<h3> (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4lookat(viewerPos, [lookingAt], [up])</h3>Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix that represents a camera view,
transforming world space coordinates, shared by every object in a scene, to coordinates in <i>eye space</i>
(also called <i>camera space</i> or <i>view space</i>). This essentially rotates a "camera"
and moves it to somewhere in the scene. In eye space:<ul>
<li>The "camera" is located at the origin (0,0,0), or
at <code>viewerPos</code> in world space,
and points away from the viewer toward the <code>lookingAt</code>
position in world space. This generally
puts <code>lookingAt</code> at the center of the view.
<li>The X axis points rightward from the "camera"'s viewpoint.
<li>The Y axis points upward from the center of the "camera" to its top. The
<code>up</code> vector guides this direction.
<li>The Z axis is parallel to the direction from the "camera"
to the <code>lookingAt</code> point.</ul><p>
This method is designed for use in a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">right-handed coordinate system</a>

13th, and 15th elements of the result (zero-based indices 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,

See the examples below.<li><code>lookingAt</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>) (optional)<br>A 3-element vector specifying the point in world space that the "camera" is looking at. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is the coordinates (0,0,0).<li><code>up</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>) (optional)<br>A 3-element vector specifying the direction from the center of the "camera" to its top.

<h3> (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4multiply(a, b)</h3>Multiplies two 4 &times; 4 matrices. A new matrix is returned.
The matrices are multiplied such that the transformations
they describe happen in reverse order. For example, if the first
matrix (input matrix) describes a translation and the second
matrix describes a scaling, the multiplied matrix will describe
the effect of scaling then translation.
<p>The matrix multiplication is effectively done by breaking up matrix <code>b</code>
into four 4-element vectors (the first 4 elements make up the first vector, and so on),
transforming each vector with
matrix <code>a</code>, and putting the vectors back together into a new matrix.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>a</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first matrix.<li><code>b</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second matrix.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix.

This method works the same way in right-handed and left-handed

A value of 45 (<code>arctan(1)</code>) indicates a cabinet projection, and a value of 63.435 (<code>arctan(2)</code>) indicates a cavalier projection.<li><code>phi</code> (Type: number)<br>Controls the apparent angle of the negative Z axis in relation to the positive X axis. In degrees. 0 means the negative Z axis appears to point in the same direction as the positive X axis, and 90, in the same direction as the positive Y axis.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix.

<h3> (static) H3DU.MathUtil.mat4ortho(l, r, b, t, n, f)</h3>Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing an <a href="tutorial-camera.html">orthographic projection</a>.
In this projection, the left clipping plane is parallel to the right clipping
plane and the top to the bottom.<p>
The projection returned by this method only scales and/or shifts the view, so that
objects with the same size won't appear smaller as they get more distant from the "camera".<p>
When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, the X, Y, and Z coordinates within the
view volume (as is the case in WebGL) will range from -1 to 1.
For a matrix in which Z coordinates range from 0 to 1, divide the 11th and 15th elements
of the result (zero-based indices 10 and 14) by 2, then add 0.5 to the 15th element.<p>

Because the shortest path is curved, not straight, this method

however, the difference in this velocity when interpolating is
rarely noticeable and this method is generally faster than
the MathUtil.quatSlerp method.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>q1</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first quaternion.

A quaternion is normalized by dividing each of its components

The result is such that the angle-axis
rotation happens before the quaternion's rotation when applied

<h3> (static) H3DU.MathUtil.quatSlerp(q1, q2, factor)</h3>Returns a quaternion that lies along the shortest path between the
given two quaternion rotations, using a spherical interpolation function.
This is called spherical linear interpolation, or "slerp". (A spherical
interpolation finds the shortest angle between the two quaternions -- which
are treated as 4D vectors -- and then finds a vector with a smaller angle
between it and the first quaternion. The "factor" parameter specifies
how small the new angle will be relative to the original angle.)<p>
This method will generally interpolate at constant velocity; however,
this method is not commutative (that is, the order in which the quaternions are given
matters), unlike quatNlerp, making it
unsuitable for blending multiple quaternion rotations,
and this method is generally more computationally expensive
than the quatNlerp method.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>q1</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first quaternion.

<h3> (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3cross(a, b)</h3>Finds the cross product of two 3-element vectors (called A and B).
The following are properties of the cross product:<ul>
<li>The cross product will be a vector that is <i>orthogonal</i> (perpendicular) to both A and B.
<li>Switching the order of A and B results in a cross product
vector with the same length but opposite direction. (Thus, the cross product is not <i>commutative</i>,
but it is <i>anticommutative</i>.)
<li>Let there be a triangle formed by point A, point B, and the point (0,0,0) in that order.
While the cross product of A and B points toward the viewer,
the triangle's vertices are oriented counterclockwise for <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">right-handed coordinate systems</a>,
or clockwise for left-handed systems. The triangle's area is half of the cross product's length.
<li>The length of the cross
product equals |<b>a</b>| &#x2a; |<b>b</b>| &#x2a; |sin &theta;|
where |<b>x</b>| is the length of vector <b>x</b>, and
&theta; is the shortest angle between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.
It follows that:<ul>
<li>If the length is 0, then A and B are parallel vectors (0 or 180 degrees apart).
<li>If A and B are <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vectors</a>, the length equals the absolute value
of the sine of the shortest angle between A and B.
<li>If A and B are unit vectors, the cross product will be a unit vector only if A is perpendicular

<h3> (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3dist(vecFrom, vecTo)</h3>Finds the straight-line distance from one three-element vector
to another, treating both as 3D points.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>vecFrom</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first 3-element vector.<li><code>vecTo</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second 3-element vector.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The distance between the two vectors.

<h3> (static) H3DU.MathUtil.vec3dot(a, b)</h3>Finds the dot product of two 3-element vectors. It's the
sum of the products of their components (for example, <b>a</b>'s X times
<b>b</b>'s X).<p>
The following are properties of the dot product:
<ul>
<li>The dot
product equals |<b>a</b>| &#x2a; |<b>b</b>| &#x2a; cos &theta;
where |<b>x</b>| is the length of vector <b>x</b>, and
&theta; is the shortest angle between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.
It follows that:<ul>
<li>A dot product of 0 indicates that the vectors are 90
degrees apart, making them <i>orthogonal</i>
(perpendicular to each other).
<li>A dot product greater than 0 means less than 90 degrees apart.
<li>A dot product less than 0 means greater than 90 degrees apart.
<li>If both vectors are <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vectors</a>, the cosine
of the shortest angle between them is equal to their dot product.
However, <code>Math.acos</code> won't return a negative angle
from that cosine, so the dot product can't
be used to determine if one vector is "ahead of" or "behind" another
vector.
<li>If both vectors are unit vectors, a dot product of 1 or -1 indicates
that the two vectors are parallel (and the vectors are 0 or
180 degrees apart, respectively.)
<li>If one of the vectors is a unit vector, the dot product's absolute
value will be the length that vector must have to make the closest
approach to the other vector's endpoint. If the dot product is negative,
the unit vector must also be in the opposite direction to approach the
other vector's endpoint.
</ul></li>
<li>If the two vectors are the same, the return value indicates
the vector's length squared. This is illustrated in the example.
<li>Switching the order of the two vectors results in the
same dot product. (Thus, the dot product is <i>commutative</i>.)
</ul><h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>a</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The first 3-element vector.<li><code>b</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>The second 3-element vector.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>A number representing the dot product.

a vector's length using the dot product.</p><pre>

<li>Switching the order of B and C, A and C, or A and B results in a triple product

results in the same triple product.
<li>The triple product's absolute value is the volume of a parallelepiped (skewed
box) where three of its sides having a vertex in common are
defined by A, B, and C, in any order.
<li>The triple product's absolute value divided by 6 is the volume of a tetrahedron,
where three of its sides having a vertex in common are

<li>If the triple product is 0, all three vectors lie on the same plane (are <i>coplanar</i>).
<li>The triple product is the same as the <i>determinant</i> (overall scaling factor)
of a 3 &times; 3 matrix whose rows or columns are the vectors A, B, and C, in that order.
<li>Assume A is perpendicular to vectors B and C. If the triple product is positive,
then A points in the same direction as the cross product of
B and C -- which will be perpendicular -- and the angle from B to C, when rotated
about vector A, is positive. If the triple product is negative, then A points in the
opposite direction from that cross product, and that angle is negative.
