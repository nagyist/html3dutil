<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This page explains how my <a href="http://peteroupc.github.io/html3dutil"><strong>HTML 3D Library</strong></a>
supports 3D shapes and how to use the library to create shapes, both built-in and custom
shapes.</p>
<p>This page will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binding mesh buffers to shapes</li>
<li>Shape groups, or combinations of several shapes</li>

<h2>Binding Shapes</h2>
<p>Once you have a mesh of a 3D shape, you still need to attach it to a shape
and a batch of shapes in order for the renderer to draw it. This is where
the <code>H3DU.Shape</code> class comes into
play; this class associates a 3D mesh with its location in the scene,
as well as its color, its appearance, and how its vertices will be transformed.
To attach a mesh to a 3D scene:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a <code>Shape</code> object by passing the mesh buffer to the <code>H3DU.Shape</code> constructor:</p>
<pre><code> var shape = new H3DU.Shape(meshBuffer);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>setPosition</code>, <code>setQuaternion</code>, and <code>setScale</code> don't change
the vertices of the underlying mesh the shape uses, but rather set up
a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html"><em>transformation matrix</em></a> that adjusts each vertex
in the shape &quot;on the fly&quot; when it comes time to draw it each frame.</p>
<p>If <code>setMatrix</code> wasn't called, then when the shape is rendered, it will generate
a transformation matrix that has the effect of scaling, then rotating,
then translating (shifting) the shape in 3D space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the shape to a 3D batch (`H3DU.Batch3D):</p>
<pre><code> batch3d.addShape(shape);
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the next time <code>scene3d.render(batch)</code> is called, the <code>H3DU.Scene3D</code> will render the
given shape to the scene through the 3D batch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a id=Shape_Groups></a></p>
<h2>Shape Groups</h2>
<p>The <code>H3DU.ShapeGroup</code> class represents a shape that's a combination of multiple shapes. Usually,
they form different pieces of a combined shape that can be positioned, rotated, and scaled
at once. Here is an example of a clock made up of multiple shapes:</p>
<p><img src="clock.png" alt="Clock"></p>
<p>This clock is made up of shapes, which
are added to a single ShapeGroup which represents the whole clock, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clock: <code>ShapeGroup</code>
<ul>
<li>Edge, faces, 12 o'clock, center: Torus, two disks, two spheres</li>
<li>Hour hand: Capsule</li>
<li>Minute hand: Capsule</li>
<li>Seconds hand: Capsule</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a shape group, call <code>new H3DU.ShapeGroup()</code>. To add a <code>Shape</code> object to the group,
call <code>new H3DU.Shape(shape)</code>. Note that you can add only shapes or other shape groups, not meshes, to a shape group.</p><p><a href='index.html'>Back to documentation index.</a></p></body></html>
