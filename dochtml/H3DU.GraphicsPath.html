<h3> new H3DU.GraphicsPath()</h3>Represents a two-dimensional path.
A path is a collection of two-dimensional line segments and/or curves. Many paths describe
closed figures or connected sequences of lines and curves. Specifically, a path is made up
of straight line segments, elliptical arcs, quadratic B&eacute;zier curves,
cubic B&eacute;zier curves, or any combination of these, and
the path can be discontinuous and/or contain closed parts.
<h4>Creating Paths</h4>
<p>
There are two ways to create paths: using an SVG path string (see <a href="H3DU.GraphicsPath.html#H3DU.GraphicsPath.fromString">H3DU.GraphicsPath.fromString</a>), or by calling methods that add its segments.
<p>A `GraphicsPath` object stores a current position and a starting position, and many methods don't have you specify a starting position, to cover the common case of drawing a series of connected lines and curves.
_.moveTo(x, y)_ - Moves the starting position and current position.
_.lineTo(x, y)_ - Adds a line segment from the current position to a new ending position.
_.closePath()_ - Closes the path by drawing a line to the starting point, if needed.
<h4>Path Segments</h4>
Each path can include a number of line segments, B&eacute;zier curves, and elliptical arcs.
Line segments are relatively easy to understand. The other two kinds of segments
deserve some discussion.
A _B&eacute;zier curve_ is a parametric curve based on a polynomial formula. In this kind of
curve the endpoints are defined as they are, but the other points define
the shape of the curve and generally don't cross the curve.
A quadratic B&eacute;zier curve uses 3 points. A cubic B&eacute;zier
curve uses 4 points.
An _elliptical arc_ is a curve which forms part of an ellipse. There are several ways to
parameterize an elliptical arc, as seen in the _.arc()_, _.arcTo()_, and _.arcSvgTo()_ methods
of the `GraphicsPath` class.<h3> Methods</h3><ul><li><a href='#H3DU.GraphicsPath_arc'>arc</a><br>Adds path segments in the form of a circular arc to this path,

<h3> (static) H3DU.GraphicsPath.fromString(str)</h3>Creates a graphics path from a string whose format follows
the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) specification.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>str</code> (Type: string)<br>A string, in the SVG path format, representing a two-dimensional path. An SVG path consists of a number of path segments, starting with a single letter, as follows: <ul> <li>M/m (x y) - Moves the current position to (x, y). Further XY pairs specify line segments. <li>L/l (x y) - Specifies line segments to the given XY points. <li>H/h (x) - Specifies horizontal line segments to the given X points. <li>V/v (y) - Specifies vertical line segments to the given Y points. <li>Q/q (cx cx x y) - Specifies quadratic B&eacute;zier curves (see quadraticCurveTo). <li>T/t (x y) - Specifies quadratic curves tangent to the previous quadratic curve. <li>C/c (c1x c1y c2x c2y x y) - Specifies cubic B&eacute;zier curves (see bezierCurveTo). <li>S/s (c2x c2y x y) - Specifies cubic curves tangent to the previous cubic curve. <li>A/a (rx ry rot largeArc sweep x y) - Specifies arcs (see arcSvgTo). "largeArc" and "sweep" are flags, "0" for false and "1" for true. "rot" is in degrees. <li>Z/z - Closes the current path; similar to adding a line segment to the first XY point given in the last M/m command. </ul> Lowercase letters mean any x- and y-coordinates are relative to the current position of the path. Each group of parameters can be repeated in the same path segment. Each parameter after the starting letter is separated by whitespace and/or a single comma, and the starting letter can be separated by whitespace. This separation can be left out as long as doing so doesn't introduce ambiguity. All commands set the current point to the end of the path segment (including Z/z, which adds a line segment if needed). Examples of this parameter are "M50,50L100,100,100,150,150,200", "M50,20C230,245,233,44,22,44", and "M50,50H80V60H50V70H50"</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The resulting path. If an error
occurs while parsing the path, the path's "isIncomplete()" method
will return <code>true</code>. (Type: GraphicsPath)<h4> Examples</h4><p>The following example creates a graphics path
from an SVG string describing a polyline.</p><pre>

<h3> H3DU.GraphicsPath#getCurves()</h3>Gets a curve evaluator object for
the curves described by this path. The return value doesn't track changes to the path.<h4> Return Value</h4>A curve evaluator object that implements
the following additional method:<ul>
<li><code>getCurves()</code> - Returns a list of curve evaluator objects
described by this path. The list will contain one curve evaluator object for each disconnected
portion of the path. For example, if the path contains one polygon, the list will contain
one curve object. And if the path is empty, the list will be empty too. Each curve
takes u-coordinates that range from 0 to 1, depending on how far the point is from the start or
the end of the path (similar to arc-length parameterization). Each curve
returns a 3-element array containing
the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the point lying on the curve at the given
"u" position (however, the z will always be 0 since paths can currently
only be 2-dimensional).

the path and evenly spaced across the length of the path,

<h3> H3DU.GraphicsPath#getTriangles([flatness])</h3>Converts the subpaths in this path to triangles.
Treats each subpath as a polygon even if it isn't closed.
Each subpath should not contain self-intersections or

whose winding order (counterclockwise or clockwise)
differs from the first subpath's winding order can be holes.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>flatness</code> (Type: number) (optional)<br>When curves and arcs are decomposed to line segments, the segments will be close to the true path of the curve by this value, given in units. If null, undefined, or omitted, default is 1.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>Array of six-element
arrays each describing a single triangle. For each six-element
array, the first two, next two, and last two numbers each
describe a vertex position of that triangle (x- and y-coordinates
