<h3> new H3DU.TextFont()</h3>Represents a bitmap font, which supports drawing two-dimensional
text. This class supports
traditional bitmap fonts and signed distance field fonts.<p>
Bitmap fonts consist of a font definition file and one
or more textures containing the shape of each font glyph. The glyphs
are packed so that the glyphs don't overlap each other.<p>
In a signed distance field font, each pixel's alpha value depends on the
distance from that location to the edge of the glyph. A pixel alpha less
than 0.5 (127 in most image formats) means the pixel is outside the
glyph, greater than 0.5 means the pixel is inside the glyph, and 0 (for
outside the glyph) and 1 (for inside the glyph) means the pixel is
outside a buffer zone formed by the glyph's outline. Each glyph is usually
given extra space to accommodate the signed distance field information.<p>
The font definition file formats supported are text (".fnt"),
JSON (".json"), binary (".fnt" or ".bin"), and XML (".xml").
The text and binary file formats are specified at
<a href="http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/doc/file_format.html">this
page</a>. The XML format is very similar to the text file format.
The JSON format is described at
<a href="https://github.com/Jam3/load-bmfont/blob/master/json-specification.md">this
page</a>.

NOTE: The constructor should not be called directly by applications.
Use the TextFont.load method to get an H3DU.TextFont object. This
constructor's parameters are undocumented and are subject to change.
<p>This class is considered a supplementary class to the
Public Domain HTML 3D Library and is not considered part of that
library. <p>
To use this class, you must include the script "extras/text.js"; the
class is not included in the "h3du_min.js" file which makes up
the HTML 3D Library. Example:<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="extras/text.js">&lt;/script></pre><p><a href='index.html'>Back to documentation index.</a></p></body></html>
