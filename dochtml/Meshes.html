<h3> new Meshes()</h3>Contains methods that create meshes
of various geometric shapes and solids, such as cubes, cylinders,
and spheres.<p>
<img src='shapes.png' alt='An assortment of shapes: a red box, a blue sphere, a bright green 2D ring, and an
orange partial ring on the first row; and a yellow 3D ring, a brown cylinder, a dark
green square, and a purple cone on the second row.'/>
<b>What are normals?</b> A normal is a set of numbers (usually three numbers) describing a particular direction. Generally, a normal's direction is perpendicular to a surface's edges, and points up and
away from the surface. For 3D graphics libraries to calculate a mesh buffer's lighting and shading correctly, that mesh buffer must specify normals for all its vertices.<p><p>
Normals are important in the lighting and shading model. When light hits an object's surface, how brightly the surface will be lit depends on how directly the light points to the surface. It will be lit the most brightly if the light is directly opposite to its normal, and not at all if the light is perpendicular to the normal or in the same direction as the normal.<p>
In general, vertex normals are 3-dimensional
and are defined for a mesh buffer only if it
also contains vertex positions.<p>
<b>What are texture coordinates?</b> If a texture (array of memory units) will be applied to a mesh buffer's geometry, then texture coordinates need to be specified for each vertex in that mesh buffer. In general, a texture coordinate is one of two numbers, called U and V, that map to a specific point in the texture. Each texture coordinate ranges from 0 to 1.<p>
In most 3D graphics pipelines, u-coordinates start at the left of the texture (0) and increase to the right (1). In some graphics pipelines, such as OpenGL, v-coordinates start by default at the bottom of the texture (0) and increase to the top (1), whereas in others, such as WebGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct3D, v-coordinates start by default at the top of the texture and increase to the bottom. Thus, for example, in OpenGL by default, texture coordinates (0, 1) indicate the upper-left corner of the texture, and texture coordinates (0.5, 0.5) indicate the center of the texture.<p>
In general, texture coordinates describe 2-dimensional points.
However, for such texturing tasks as mapping
a square to a trapezoid, trios of 3-dimensional texture coordinates (U, V, and Z)
are useful to ensure the texturing remains perspective-correct.
In this case, the 3-D texture coordinates are converted
to 2-D by dividing the U and V components by the Z component.
In a fragment shader or pixel shader, this can look like
the following
code: <code>texCoord.xy/texCoord.z</code>.<h3> Methods</h3><ul><li><a href='#Meshes.createBox'>createBox</a><br>Creates a mesh of a box (rectangular prism), which

<h3> (static) Meshes.createBox(xSize, ySize, zSize, [inward])</h3>Creates a mesh of a box (rectangular prism), which
will be centered at the origin.
Will create texture coordinates such that the same texture
is used on each face of the box. Texture coordinates are generated assuming that the coordinate (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right
corner. The resulting mesh buffer
will use 36 vertex indices divided into 12 triangles, with each
face using two triangles. The faces will be ordered as follows:
Negative-x axis-facing face, positive-x axis-facing face, negative-y axis-facing face,
positive-y axis-facing face, negative-z axis-facing face, positive-z axis-facing face.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>xSize</code> (Type: number)<br>Width of the box.<li><code>ySize</code> (Type: number)<br>Height of the box.<li><code>zSize</code> (Type: number)<br>Depth of the box. If xSize, ySize, and zSize are the same number, the result is a cube.<li><code>inward</code> (Type: boolean) (optional)<br>If true, the normals generated by this method will point inward; otherwise, outward. Should normally be false unless the box will be viewed from the inside.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>A buffer geometry. The generated mesh. (Type: *)<a name='Meshes.createBoxEx'></a>

is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right

<h3> (static) Meshes.createCapsule([radius], [length], [slices], [stacks], [middleStacks], [flat], [inside])</h3>Creates a mesh of a capsule, centered at the origin.

coordinates start from the bottom of the texture and increase from the negative
to positive z-axis, and the U (horizontal) coordinates start from the left of the
texture and increase from the positive X to positive Y to negative X to negative
Y to positive x-axis. Texture coordinates are generated assuming that the coordinate (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right
corner. <p>
If the "length" parameter is 0, the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of a point on the solid

positive z-axis. The base and top themselves will not be
included in the mesh.<p>
Texture coordinates for the cylinder (other than the base) will
be generated such that the V (vertical)
coordinates start from the bottom of the texture and increase from the origin
to the positive z-axis, and the U (horizontal) coordinates start from the left of the
texture and increase from the positive X to positive Y to negative X to negative
Y to positive x-axis. Texture coordinates are generated assuming that the coordinate (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right
corner. <p>
The x-, y-, and z-coordinates of a point on the cylinder are

&lambda; is the longitude in radians, H = <code>height</code>,
R = <code>baseRad + (topRad - baseRad) * &phi;</code>,
and west and south latitudes and
longitudes are negative. (The formula for converting latitude
and longitude is mentioned here because their meaning depends on
exactly how the texture coordinates are generated on the cylinder.
It assumes that in the texture, longitudes range from -180&deg; to 0&deg; to 180&deg; from
left to right, and latitudes range from 90&deg; to 0&deg; to -90&deg; from top to bottom.)<p>
