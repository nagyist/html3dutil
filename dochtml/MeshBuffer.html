<h3> new MeshBuffer()</h3><p><b>Deprecated: It is planned to render this class obsolete and rely on three.js's BufferGeometry.</b></p><p><b>Instancing</b>
<p>Some 3D rendering pipelines support <i>instancing</i>, which is a technique for rendering multiple versions of a mesh buffer with a single draw call. Instancing involves the use of a second mesh buffer (an <i>instance buffer</i>); rather than holding vertex data, the instance buffer holds <i>instance data</i>, that is, data to be used when rendering each instance of the first mesh buffer. Besides this, however, instance buffers are largely similar to vertex buffers as far as the <code>MeshBuffer</code> class is concerned; any reference to vertices in the documentation applies analogously to instances in instance buffers. However, instance buffers should use the primitive type <code>MeshBuffer.POINTS</code>; it makes little sense to have instance buffers describe triangles or line segments.<h3> Members</h3><ul><li><a href='#MeshBuffer.LINES'>LINES</a><br>Indicates that a mesh buffer contains line segments; the mesh
