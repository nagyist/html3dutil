<h3> new MeshBuffer()</h3><p><b>Deprecated: It is planned to render this class obsolete and rely on three.js's BufferGeometry.</b></p>A geometric mesh in the form of buffer objects.
A mesh buffer is made up of one or more <a href="BufferAccessor.html">vertex attribute objects</a>,
and an optional array of vertex indices. Each vertex attribute object contains
the values of one attribute of the mesh, such as positions,
vertex normals, and texture coordinates. A mesh buffer
can store vertices that make up triangles, line segments, or points.<p>
This constructor creates an empty mesh buffer and sets the array
of vertex indices to null and the primitive type to <a href="MeshBuffer.html#MeshBuffer.TRIANGLES">MeshBuffer.TRIANGLES</a>.<p>
The `MeshBuffer` class contains four methods (`fromPositions`,
`fromPositionsNormals`, `fromPositionsUV`, and `fromPositionsNormalsUV`) that let you define a mesh buffer from a predefined array of vertex data. See the documentation for those methods for more information.<p>
The <a href="Meshes.html">`Meshes`</a> class includes several handy methods for creating built-in shapes; those methods return a `MeshBuffer` object that describes the triangles they
are composed of.
<p><b>Instancing</b>
<p>Some 3D rendering pipelines support <i>instancing</i>, which is a technique for rendering multiple versions of a mesh buffer with a single draw call. Instancing involves the use of a second mesh buffer (an <i>instance buffer</i>); rather than holding vertex data, the instance buffer holds <i>instance data</i>, that is, data to be used when rendering each instance of the first mesh buffer. Besides this, however, instance buffers are largely similar to vertex buffers as far as the <code>MeshBuffer</code> class is concerned; any reference to vertices in the documentation applies analogously to instances in instance buffers. However, instance buffers should use the primitive type <code>MeshBuffer.POINTS</code>; it makes little sense to have instance buffers describe triangles or line segments.<h3> Members</h3><ul><li><a href='#MeshBuffer.LINES'>LINES</a><br>Indicates that a mesh buffer contains line segments; the mesh
